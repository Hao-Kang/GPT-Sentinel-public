InstaWeather Pro makes it easy to not only share how good or bad the weather is but also lets you add a photo that will show off the conditions. The Windows Phone app normally runs $.99 but for through the myAppFree campaign, you can pick it up for free over the next twenty-four hours.
InstaWeather Pro isn't your typical Windows Phone weather app. The Windows Phone app lets you snap a photo, add an overlay of your current conditions and share the final image with your friends quickly and easily.
The concept with InstaWeather Pro is rather simple. You snap a photo at 1:1 aspect ratio (perfect for Instagram) and choose an overlay that reflects the weather conditions at your current location. Once saved, you can share the image over social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram or share it by SMS or email.
Overlays range from the basic temperature and location to more inspirational images. You also have the option to choose an overlay that reflects an extended forecast (up to a week). Overlays are arranged in sets that include the seasons of the year as well as hipster, travel, lifestyle, oxygen, rainbow and weather tv sets. There is so many overlays to choose from, you may find it difficult to settle on just one.
InstaWeather Pro normally runs $.99 but through myAppFree, you can pick the Windows Phone app up for free.
Please note that it may take a short while before InstaWeather Pro appears in the myAppFree Windows Phone app (blame all the time zones). However, the deal is already reflected in the app's Windows Phone Store listing.
