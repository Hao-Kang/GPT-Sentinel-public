After succumbing to a hip injury, Nick Kyrgios has come to the decision to take rest and heal. This has led him to reflect on 2017, with its highs and lows, from consecutive wins against great tennis players to the difficulties he faced at Grand Slams. However, his fondest memories were from team events, particularly the Laver Cup and the Davis Cup. Kyrgios reveals that tennis can be a lonely sport, and he often struggles with it. However, he praises the team spirit in Davis Cup, highlighting how they all support each other, win or lose, and says it made him feel like he was part of the team. 
Rusty, Davis Cup captain, created a WhatsApp group a year and a half ago, which includes all the Davis Cup players. Kyrgios recounts how, after his semi-final win in Beijing, his phone was flooded with loyal messages from the coaches and players. This sparked his realization that it had become bigger than tennis, and they had become a family trying to keep in touch no matter how far apart they all were. He feels it has helped provide a support system for everyone, both on and off the court, at a time when they really needed it the most. 
Kyrgios explains how Davis Cup's team culture has changed significantly, emphasising the sense of teamwork and selflessness amongst his teammates. He compares it to the days before Captain Lleyton Hewitt, where individual players didn't offer much support or motivation to each other. He believes that experiencing the highs and lows has helped him appreciate the team spirit and emphasized its importance. He shares his desire to prioritize team events over Grand Slams in 2018, and admits that winning as a team is much more enjoyable than winning alone. 
Participating in the Laver Cup was an innovative experience, and he saw it as an excellent opportunity to team up with players from other countries and compete with great tennis players. He appreciated spending time with John McEnroe, and forming a connection with him, based on their common character traits. McEnroe offered advice and created an engaging environment for Kyrgios during his match against Roger Federer. Kyrgios respects McEnroe's experience and enjoys his company, but states that he may not work with him since he does not feel ready for coaching. Kyrgios concludes that despite the highs and lows of the past year, he will strive to improve for the upcoming year.
